**1. Long Methods**
- Methods like `_showAddTaskForm()` and `_showTaskDialog()` are too long and handle multiple responsibilities.    
Solution: Break these methods into smaller helper methods using the **Extract Method** refactoring pattern.

**2. Duplication of Logic**
- Time conversion logic is repeated in multiple places (e.g., `_showAddTaskForm`, `_showTaskDialog`).  
Solution: Create a utility class, e.g., `TimeConverter`, to centralize this logic.

**3. Large Class**
- `_TaskTrackerState` has too many responsibilities, including UI management, input validation, and database interactions.  
**Why it's a problem**: Violates the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and makes the class harder to maintain.  
Solution: split the logic into smaller classes, e.g., `TaskValidator` for validation and `TaskService` for database operations.

**4. Overloaded Stateful Widgets**
- Widgets like `_TaskTrackerState` handle both UI and state logic.  
Solution: Use a state management library like **Provider** or **Riverpod** to separate state logic from UI.

**5. Hardcoded Strings**
- Strings like `"Task added successfully!"` and `"Invalid Time"` are hardcoded throughout the code.    
Solution: Move all strings to a constants file, e.g., `strings.dart`.

**6. Tight Coupling**
- The `_TaskTrackerState` class is tightly coupled with Firestore, making the database logic inseparable from the application logic.  
Solution: Implement the **Repository Pattern** to abstract database interactions.

**7. Bloated Constructors**
- The `TimeInputWidget` requires direct initialization of UI elements with functions and labels.  
Solution: Use factory methods or named constructors to simplify widget creation and ensure modularity.

**8. Lack of Input Validation**
- Thereâ€™s minimal input validation for fields like `date`, `startTime`, and `endTime`.  
Solution: Use a **TaskValidator** class to validate inputs before processing.

**9. Unclear Error Handling**
- Error handling is inconsistent and lacks detailed logging or user feedback. For example, `_addNewTask()` simply displays a generic error message.   
Solution: Standardize error handling and use a centralized error handler.

### **10. Single Large UI Method**
- `_showAddTaskForm()` mixes widget creation and logic in a single method.  
Solution: Use smaller helper methods to build different sections of the UI, such as `createTimeInputSection()` or `createDateInputField()`.
